name = 'Bob'
save_name = name
name.upcase!
puts name, save_name

This code prints out BOB BOB (on separate lines). The reason for this is that both name and save_name are referencing the exact same string object. Thus, when the mutating #upcase! method is invoked on name, it modifies the string object to which both variables point. This leads to the values which both variables reference being modified, not only name.
