Welcome Stranger

Create a method that takes 2 arguments, an array and a hash. The array will contain 2 or more elements that, when combined with adjoining spaces, will produce a person's name. The hash will contain two keys, :title and :occupation, and the appropriate values. Your method should return a greeting that uses the person's full name, and mentions the person's title and occupation.

  Input(s): Array (2+ elements) and a hash ( title: String, occupation: String )
  Output(s): String of text which combines the array into a full name and also mentions the title and occupation given in the hash
  
  Explicit Rules:
    Combine the array elements to make a full name.
    Output the full name and also mention the title and occupation passed in as args in the hash
  Implicit Rules:
    No concern regarding return valueâ€”this is a side-effect method.
