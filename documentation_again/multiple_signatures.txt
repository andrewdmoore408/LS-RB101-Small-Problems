# The %w() literal makes an array of strings (without needing to wrap each string in quote marks and use commas)

# Array#fetch retrieves an array element using the index provided.

# puts a.fetch(7) will return an error--the index is out of bounds.

# puts a.fetch(7, 'beats me') will return 'beats me' because that was provided in case the index is not in the array bounds

# puts a.fetch(7) { |index| index **2 } will return 49, which is 7 squared. The offset provided is out of bounds and so the block is executed with the argument passed being used as the local variable for the block.
