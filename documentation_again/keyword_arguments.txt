# This code prints 5 and then 8 (on a newline). The keywords (named arguments followed by a colon) allow for arguments to be given in a different order, since the names assign the arguments to the relevant parameter.

Document for Number#step shows that this statement begins with 5 and then increases by 3 until the number is above the limit (10 in this case). Only two numbers, 5 and 8, match those conditions, and they are both output using puts since that's the code in the block.
